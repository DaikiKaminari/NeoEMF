/**
 * Provides generic classes representing data management operations.
 * <p>
 * This package defines a set of abstract classes defining the low-level backend operations and the model-to-backend
 * mapping. They are extended in backend-specific packages with a concrete implementation tailored to the corresponding
 * backend.
 * <p>
 * Every backend supported by NeoEMF implements the {@link fr.inria.atlanmod.neoemf.data.Backend} interface, that
 * defines a set of primitives that allows the core component to access a database and serialize model elements. These
 * specific implementations have to be registered in the {@link fr.inria.atlanmod.neoemf.data.BackendFactoryRegistry} to
 * allow their instanciation by the framework.
