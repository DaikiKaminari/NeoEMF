/**
 * Provides simple representations of objects used to translate model-level operations in persistence calls.
 * <p>
 * This package define a set of abstraction that can be used by {@link fr.inria.atlanmod.neoemf.data.store.Store}
 * subclasses as an intermediate layer between the backend level and the model level. For example, the {@link
 * fr.inria.atlanmod.neoemf.data.bean.SingleFeatureBean} class can be used to represent a containment link between two
 * elements. These abstract structures are useful to manipulate the model at a low-level without knowing the concrete
 * model-to-backend mapping used.
